# Problem 77. Combinations

Given two integers ```n``` and ```k```, return all possible combinations of ```k``` numbers chosen from the range ```[1, n]```.

You may return the answer in any order. 

__Example 1:__

➡️ Input: n = 4, k = 2

➡️ Output: [[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]]

➡️ Explanation: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 total combinations.

⚠️ Note that combinations are unordered, i.e., [1, 2] and [2, 1] are considered to be the same combination.

__Example 2:__

➡️ Input: n = 1, k = 1

➡️ Output: [[1]]

➡️ Explanation: There is 1 choose 1 = 1 total combination.
 

__Constraints:__
- ```1 <= n <= 20```
- ```1 <= k <= n```
