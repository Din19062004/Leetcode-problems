# Problem 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs

Given a linked list, __swap every two adjacent nodes__ and return _its head_. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

 
__Example 1:__

✅ Input: ```head = [1,2,3,4]```

✅ Output: ```[2,1,4,3]```

__Example 2:__

✅ Input: ```head = []```

✅ Output: ```[]```

__Example 3:__

✅ Input: ```head = [1]```

✅ Output: ```[1]```

__Example 4:__

✅ Input: ```head = [1,2,3]```

✅ Output: ```[2,1,3]```

__Constraints:__
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range ```[0, 100]```.
- ```0 <= Node.val <= 100```
