# Leetcode day by day

### Welcome to my LeetCode challenge :partying_face:

   I've started using LeetCode to learn Data Structer and Algorithm.
   
   Most of the solutions were coded in ```C```, partly beacause I was learning this programming language during the DSA course at university.
   
   Some of them have been added solutions using ```Java``` or ```C++``` (or even ```assembly language```:grinning:).  

   Each problem contains:
   - ```Description.md```: You can read this file to understand all the problem's contexts (inputs, outputs, constraints, ...). In some problems, I also added a link for a ```.pdf``` file which shows my further explanation about the algorithm I used.
     
   - ```Solution.*```: This is my solution for the problem. ```.*``` could be ```.c```, ```.cpp```, ```.java``` (or ```.asm```), depending on the programming language I have chosen to solve the problem.
  
   Hope you enjoy it! If you have any contribution, don't hesitate to contact me at email address: haivietb9@gmail.com.

   __Notice:__ All solutions are only used to submit on Leetcode with appropriate programming language. :no_entry:
